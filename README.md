	Basic Typo3 Setup Framework Version 0.1

This is a basic root for setting up a typo3 website.

typo3 is an open source gpl'd content management system from http://typo3.org

while it lags really good blogging features (sorry @ wordpress fans, we are not there yet)
it is very stable, and very common in europe for company websites.

This is the base for my own website http://www.neverslair-blog.net, built with easy of use in mind
feel free to use it for your own websites, change it, and let me
know what you make out of it.

you can reach me via my website:

a base structure and description can be found in filedescription.txt
